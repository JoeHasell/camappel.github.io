<h2>Overall Income Inequality</h2>
<h3>Gini coefficient - Equivalised disposable household income</h3>
<p>Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable weekly household income from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, linked at 1994 to the LIS series for Gini coefficient of equivalised disposable household income. The ABS figures indicate a break in the series in 2007 due to a change in methodology that was also partially applied in the 2003–04 and 2005–06 series. It notes that "Estimates presented for 2007–08 onwards are not directly comparable with estimates for previous cycles due to the improvements made to measuring income introduced in the 2007–08 cycle. Estimates for 2003–04 and 2005–06 have been recompiled to reflect the new measures of income, however not all components introduced in 2007–08 are available for earlier cycles." The comparability of the surveys conducted over the decade to 2010 is discussed in more detail by Wilkins (2014), who concludes that due to the changes in survey methodology, "it is not possible to produce deﬁnitive estimates of income inequality trends between 2001 and 2010."</p><h4>Visualization of source data</h4>
